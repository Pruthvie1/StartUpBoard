        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>PharmEasy is an online pharmacy and medical store in India which specialises in OTC products, diagnostic tests, and medical instruments. The company was founded in 2015 in Mumbai, Maharashtra and has seen incredible growth since then.  It is an online pharmacy with every product you could ever imagine in an offline medical store.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has become an essential service that has contributed to its growth. The competitors of PharmEasy in India are 1mg and Netmeds. This health tech startup has raised a massive $350 million, becoming the first Epharmacy unicorn in India. The funding has been raised after the merger of PharmEasy with its rival Medlife.

PharmEasy has acquired a 100 per cent stake in Medlife, and the latter got a 19.95% stake in the merged entity. Both the companies have joined hands and merged in order to beat off the competition from rival players like Netmeds (Reliance Jio), Flipkart and Amazon Pharmacy who have just entered the pharmacy segment in India.

The investors of PharmEasy are the ones who also invested in the startups like Swiggy and Byjuâ€™s. The founders Dharmil Sheth and Dr Dhaval Shah have planned to reach over 100,000 pharmacies in the next 12 months in the new geographical markets of India.</p>
